## What is a Forum

A forum is a form of social media in which users post threads to boards, and in which users can post replies to threads. Traditionally, threads are displayed in a list categorized by board, and sorted chronologically by the date of the most recent reply. Replies to threads are displayed chronologically as well. Traditional forums paginated board and thread displays, while some moderns ones (ex. Discourse) have infinite scrolling.

Other hallmark features include user signatures, rich text formatting, and thread subscription.

## Why a Forum

Forums are, I think, potentially, the most user-friendly form of asynchronous (as opposed to synchronous, e.g. IRC, Discord) social media.

## Comparison to Centralized Forums

### Discourse

Discourse isn't a single monolithic entity; instead, people can make their own instances of it. It isn't federated, though, and it is, as far as I can tell, mostly designed for business use. A few of its design decisions are questionable, too: threads are all presented together by default -- as opposed to by board -- so it feels a bit muddy to use. It also uses interaction metrics heavily for sorting, etc., which I want to avoid with Bonfire. 

### Reddit

Reddit is designed as a link aggregator, but it has mostly usurped traditional forums, so I'm categorizing it here.

I believe that Reddit's achronological design and focus on points for algorithmic sorting discourage, intentionally or not, community memory -- that is, accumulation & conglomeration of knowledge within a community. This, in turn, prevents growth of a community identity.

It doesn't help that Reddit's search function sucks.

### Mastodon/Pleroma/etc. (ActivityPub Fediverse)

These replicate twitter, which is fine, but that design is
